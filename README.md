A Cisco Packet Tracer simulation showing LAN threat detection using ACLs and port security.
# Cisco LAN Threat Simulation

This project simulates a small LAN environment in Cisco Packet Tracer to demonstrate basic network threat detection using:

- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Switch Port Security

## 🔧 Devices Used
- 1 Router (1841)
- 1 Switch (2960)
- 2 PCs (User & Attacker)

## 🛡️ Security Features
- PC0 (User) is allowed to access router
- PC1 (Attacker) is blocked by ACL
- Port security restricts unknown MAC addresses on the switch

## 📁 Files
- `kishor_threat_simulation.pkt` — Packet Tracer project
- `Cisco_ThreatSimulation_Report.docx` — Project documentation

## 🎓 Purpose
Created as part of academic project preparation for PhD in cybersecurity and networking.
